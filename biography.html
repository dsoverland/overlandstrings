                <div class="title">Biography<br><div style="text-align: center;">
<br><div style="text-align: left;">I was born in Duluth and
                      received the best of my music education there. After
                      graduation from UMD in 1956 I spent two years playing in
                      Europe with the Seventh Army Symphony, a really first rate
                      orchestra made up of young professional musicians drafted
                      out of symphonies and universities across the USA. After
                      leaving the Army I played one season with the Boston
                      "Pops" under Arthur Fiedler before beginning my teaching
                      career in Garden City, Kansas. After three years in Kansas
                      I returned to Minnesota, married my wonderful wife Etta,
                      and taught for two years in Rochester before moving to
                      Moundsview to begin the string program in 1964. As you
                      know, the Moundsview Orchestra Department has developed
                      into one of the finest Orchestra Programs in the state due
                      to its many fine teachers and a first class school system.
                      In the mid 70's I graduated with a Master's Degree from
                      the University of Minnesota.<br><br>
                      After 30 years I retired from public school teaching but
                      not from "music teaching." I have had as many as 32
                      private students but at the present teach 15 students
                      weekly&mdash;although I think I could easily handle 20 students
                      weekly. <br><br>
                      During my years in Moundsview I have played, as a free
                      lance musician, in the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, the
                      "Golden Strings&lt;" under Cliff Brunzell and many other
                      venues in the Twin Cities area.<br><br>
