After                      graduation from UMD in 1956 I spent two years playing in                      Europe with the Seventh Army Symphony, a really first rate                      orchestra made up of young professional musicians drafted                      out of symphonies and universities across the USA. After                      leaving the Army I played one season with the Boston                      "Pops" under Arthur Fiedler before beginning my teaching                      career in Garden City, Kansas. After three years in Kansas                      I returned to Minnesota, married my wonderful wife Etta,                      and taught for two years in Rochester before moving to                      Moundsview to begin the string program in 1964. As you                      know, the Moundsview Orchestra Department has developed                      into one of the finest Orchestra Programs in the state due                      to its many fine teachers and a first class school system.                      In the mid 70's I graduated with a Master's Degree from                      the University of Minnesota.<br />                      <br />                      After 30 years I retired from public school teaching but                      not from "music teaching." I have had as many as 32                      private students but at the present teach 15 students                      weekly—although I think I could easily handle 20 students                      weekly. <br />                      <br />                      During my years in Moundsview I have played, as a free                      lance musician, in the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, the                      "Golden Strings&lt;" under Cliff Brunzell and many other                      venues in the Twin Cities area.<br />                      <br />                      Doug Overland<br />                    </div>                  </div>                </div>                <p> </p>              </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>        <div class="bottom">Copyright © 2003-2005 OverlandStrings.com   |            Designed by <a class="bottom" href="http://www.plisher.org/design">Sonia
